# 16740 Final Project

Localization with extrasensory perception

## Feedback from Prof. Kroemer:

- model problem as a state estimation of where the sound source is
- loudness -> should it be continuous or discretized?
- how do you choose the actions quickly to reduce uncertainty?
- test out different sampling approaches to choose action
- sound: should be constant loud sound in a quiet area
